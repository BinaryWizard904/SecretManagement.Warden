# SecretManagement extension for BitWarden
This module is an extension vault for the PowerShell SecretManagement module. It wraps around the official [Bitwarden CLI](https://github.com/bitwarden/clients/tree/master/apps/cli) to interface with Bitwarden and Vaultwarden instances. This module works over all supported PowerShell platforms on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Supported Commands:
`Get-Secret`, `Get-SecretInfo`, `Remove-Secret`, `Set-Secret`, `Test-SecretVault`, `Unlock-SecretVault`

Unsupported Commands:
`Set-SecretInfo`


> **NOTE: This is not an official Bitwarden project.**

## Prerequisites

Download and Install

* [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
* The [`bitwarden-cli`](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/cli/#download-and-install)

## Installation

You an install this module from the PowerShell Gallery:

Using PowerShellGet v2:

```pwsh
Install-Module SecretManagement.BitWarden
```

Using PowerShellGet v3:

```pwsh
Install-PSResource SecretManagement.BitWarden
```

## Registration

Once you have it installed,
you need to register the module as an extension:

```pwsh
Register-SecretVault -ModuleName SecretManagement.BitWarden
```
If you wish to use any non-default configurations, put them in a hashtable and pass that to `Register-SecretVault` with the `-VaultParameters` parameter.

Example:
```pwsh
$VaultParameters = @{
	ExportObjectsToSecureNotesAs = "CliXml"
	EncodingOfSecrets = "unicode"
	MaximumObjectDepth = 4
}
Register-SecretVault -ModuleName SecretManagement.BitWarden -VaultParameters $VaultParameters
```


Optionally, you can set it as the default vault by also providing the
`-DefaultVault`
parameter.

### Registration Vault Parameters
When registering the vault you can include a HashTable of vault parameters to configure client behavior.  These are passed to implementing functions as `$AdditionalParameters`.

**Supported Vault Parameters**

| Name | Description | Type | Possible Values | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | -----| --------------- | ------- |
| **ExportObjectsToSecureNotesAs** | Changes what PowerShell Objects are converted into so they can be stored as a Secure Note in the vault.<br><br>Defaults to JSON for interoperability with other languages.  However, CliXml has superior type support and compatability with older versions of PowerShell.  It can be used to store an *exact* copy of the object, including custom typing, in the vault. See [Export-Clixml](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/export-clixml) for details. | String | CliXml, JSON | JSON |
| **EncodingOfSecrets** | Changes the character encoding of secrets for functions that support it. This should be set to match the encoding of your vault storage (or be a subset, i.e. ASCII is a subset of UTF-8). Supports all [PowerShell supported character encodings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_character_encoding). | [Encoding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding) | ascii, bigedianunicode, bigendianutf32, oem, unicode, utf7 utf8, utf8BOM, utf8NoBom\*, utf32 | utf8BOM |
| **MaximumObjectDepth** | Specifies how many levels of contained objects are included in the CliXml/JSON representation. | Int32 | 1â€“100 | 2 |

\* Unsupported on Powershell 5.x

## Special Thanks
Special Thanks to @TylerLeonhardt for publishing a baseline for this module extension. Please check out his [`LastPass Extention`](https://github.com/TylerLeonhardt/SecretManagement.LastPass)

Special thanks to @realslacker for his excellent [bitwarden cli wrapper](https://github.com/realslacker/BitwardenWrapper).  A stripped down and heavily modified version of it was utilized to replace `Invoke-bwcmd`.
